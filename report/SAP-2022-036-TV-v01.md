# Context

## Objectives

Calculate the minimum sample size to be able to detect the prevalence of sleep disturbance as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in Judo athletes.

## Hypotheses

# Data

## Raw data

N/A

## Analytical dataset

N/A

# Study parameters

## Study design

This is a single-arm cross-sectional study.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Professional judo athletes aged 18+ years old will be included.

## Exposures

N/A

## Outcomes

**Specification of outcome measures** (Zarin, 2011):

1. (Domain) Sleep quality
2. (Specific measurement) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
3. (Specific metric) End value
4. (Method of aggregation) Proportion of participants with PSQI > 5

**Primary outcome**

Proportion of study participants with PSQI > 5.

## Covariates

N/A

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

N/A

### Inferential analyses

N/A

### Statistical modeling

N/A

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
<!-- All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses. -->

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power


Table: **Table 1** Parameters for sample size calculation.

|              Parameter               | Value |
|:------------------------------------:|:-----:|
|   Target population size (chosen)    | 3899  |
| True population prevalence (assumed) |  20%  |
|          Tolerance (chosen)          |  50%  |
|   Diagnostic sensitivity (chosen)    | 89.6% |
|   Diagnostic specificity (chosen)    | 86.5% |

- Sample size (calculated): 136

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.2.1.

# Observations and limitations

**Recommended reporting guideline**

The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals.
All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014).
